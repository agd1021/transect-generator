## Tools:
### 0) Random Transects
Given a single input polygon, transect length, and buffer distance around transects, iteratively places non-intersecting transects of random bearings until no more can be placed 
or the number of attempts maxes out. 
### 1) Maximize Number of Random Transects
Iterates "0) Random Transects" in a while-loop with user-defined end-point to maximize the number of random transects placed in the polygon.
### 2) Transect Points and Bearing to CSV
Given an input transect shapefile, drops points at the start, end, and midpoint of every transect. Outputs coordinate locations as a CSV.
### 3) Textfile to Histogram
Creates a histogram image from the output textfile generated by the Maximize Number of Random Transects tool.
